# course-management-api


##  DescripciÃ³n
Course Management API allows you to explore and manage courses. This API provides functionality to know and modify the available courses, as well as to track the progress of users in these courses. It is designed to expose information so that any frontend can easily consume it.

The project is based on the development of an API using Node.js and Express to create a web server that allows exploring and managing courses. Express is used as the Node.js web framework, providing an organized and simplified structure for handling HTTP routes, requests, and responses. Sequelize is used as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the MySQL database. In addition, other complementary technologies can be used to develop additional functionalities, thus ensuring the efficiency and scalability of the system.
